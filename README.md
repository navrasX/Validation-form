<<<<<<< One-field-validation
# Singup/Log in - Practice

I'm learning Javascript and getting into Web Development.

Nothing planned yet , just trying to figure out stuff that pops out of my mind.

Currently, my goal is to be able to manipulate the DOM effectively.
My first try is to make the login button to change to red color when
the user puts the wrong data in the fields; it would turn green if all data
fills the requirements. An extension to this would be the buttom turning yellow if just
some of the fields are filled correctly.

Ideally it will change the text content of the buttom to help the user
figure out which field is wrong or missing without adding a new text element.

All of this should be accomplished without needing to click the button;
the idea is for it to change dinamically as the user is typing and filling the fields.
For instance, if the user gets the email right but he missed the code (cÃ²digo), the
buttom would suggest to take a look at the code field.

-------------One-field-validation--------------

While the original idea sounded cool in my mind to play around and do something "different" as an exercise, I realized
it was not practical or convenient at all for a good user experiencee, due to the fact that several errors in different fields would not be properly displayed or helpful to the user to noticed in which fields user put the wrong data.

This said, my next approach is to make something "useful" first, then I will play around that usefulness to see what kind of stuff would come out of it.
