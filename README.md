# Form validation- Practice

I'm  learning Javascript and getting into Web Development.

Nothing planned yet , just trying to figure out stuff that pops out of my mind.

Currently, my goal is to be able to manipulate the DOM effectively.
My first try is to make the login button to change to red color when
the user puts the wrong data in the fields; it would turn green if all data
fills the requirements. An extension to this would be the buttom turning yellow if just
some of the fields are filled correctly.

Ideally it will change the text content of the buttom to help the user
figure out which field is wrong or missing without adding a new text element.

All of this should be accomplished without needing to click the button; 
the idea is for it to change dinamically  as the user is typing and filling the fields.
For instance, if the user gets the email right but he missed the code (c√≤digo), the
buttom would suggest to take a look at the code field.
